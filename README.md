# machine-learning-notebooks
This repository has a set of different machine learning jupyter notebooks with a variety of ML problems code through my own learning journey.

The idea is to extract datasets, analyze the data, use data engineering to process the data to later applied machine learning algorithms.

The project uses Python and the following libraries:
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
